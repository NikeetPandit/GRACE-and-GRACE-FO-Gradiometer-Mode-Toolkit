function DATAxyzIRF = ITRFtoIRF(DATAxyzITRF, varargin) 
% ITRFtoIRF is a function decorator for MATLAB's dcmeci2ecef to rotate a
%   vector to IRF from ITRF.
% 
%   See: https://www.mathworks.com/help/aerotbx/ug/dcmeci2ecef.html
% 
%   The purpose of the decorator is to provide abstraction to calculation
%   and inclusion of higher-order terms in dcmeci2ecef function, and to
%   include performance improvements. Uses IAU 2000/2006 resolution to 
%   comply with the IERS-2010 recommendations. 
%   
%   Uses: mjuliandate, polarMotion, deltaCIP, deltaUT1 MATLAB function's. 
%
%   Inputs:
%   (1) DATAxyzITRF: [timeGPS, POS_X, POS_Y, POS_Z]. Size [nx4]. 
%   timeGPS is interpreted as a GPS time epoch, using the GRACE and GRACE-FO
%   convention for GPS time. 
%
%   Optional: 'none'. Input to specify the use of NO higher-order terms in
%   position vector transformation. 
% 
%   Outputs:
%   (1)  DATAxyzIRF: [timeGPS, POS_X, POS_Y, POS_Z]. Size [nx4].

%   EXTRA NOTES:
%
%   When the higher-order terms are omitted, there is an error up to 100m
%   against JPL's transformations. When they are included, there is an error 
%   at most 0.1m against JPL. 
%
%   This test was made by comparing GNV1B_ITRF data products by JPL for GRACE-FO
%   and transforming it to IRF, using ITRFtoIRF, and comparing this against
%   JPL's GNI1B data product, which provides the coordinates already in the
%   IRF frame. 
%
%   Using additional terms comes at cost of computational complexity. To
%   improve performance, rotation matrices are calculated in vectorized
%   fashion, where each successive matrix extends along a third dimension. 
%   After the rotation matrix calculations, the inputted array is reshaped along the
%   third dimension, as to allow matrix multiplication along said third
%   dimension. This is an identical operation if we  were to calculate each
%   rotation matrix for each vector individually and rotate each vector
%   element. 
%
%   See:
%   https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html
%   for more information on code vectorization and its benefits. 
%
%   In this vectorized fashion, all the data and rotation matrices are
%   brought into RAM together, as all calculations are performed
%   simaltaneously. If software lags, or computer runs into out of memory
%   errors, input a block size smaller than the length of series, and
%   experiment with this block size to find the best performance possible.
%   On my machine, which is i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz   3.19 GHz, 86400 length
%   series was fine, but 864000 (i.e., 10Hz) was too slow. If I wanted to
%   transform a series of length 864000, I put then a block size of 86400.
