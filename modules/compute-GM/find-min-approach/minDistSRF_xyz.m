function [indexA, indexB] = minDistSRF_xyz(pos_A, pos_B, SCA1B_A, dist_constraint)
%MINDistSRF_xyz finds the closest approach of a trailing satellite to a fixed leading 
%   satellite. The minimum 3-D vector seperation is found in the X, Y, and Z
%   independently of each-other. 
%
%   The minimum 3-D seperation is found between the two spacecraft where
%   position data has been rotated and referenced to the leading SRF at
%   each minimization point. Can find closest approach with respect to zero, or specify closest
%   approach to some other constant.
%
%   See the description of the algorithm for gradiometer for more details. 
%
%   Inputs:
%   (1) posA, [nx4] input matrix interpreted as [time, X, Y, Z]. Position
%       data for leading spacecraft in ECI. 
%   (2) posB, [nx4] input matrix interpreted as [time, X, Y, Z]. Position
%       data for trailing spacecraft in ECI.
%   (3) SCA1B_A, [nx5] input matrix interpreted as [time, a, b, c, d] where
%       Quaternion = a + bi + cj, + dk. SCA1B data for leading spacecraft. 
%   (4) dist_constraint, [dist_constraint_X, dist_constraint_Y,
%       dist_constraint_Z]. Can find the cloest value to zero (i.e, the
%       true minimum approach) by placing [0, 0, 0]. Or, can find the
%       minimum appproach to some other constant by placing into the
%       vector. Size is [1x3]. 
%   'leader': Place variable input to specify leader stays the leader 
%             if want to find a minimum approach between the two spacecraft
%             constrained to the fact that leader spacecraft stays the
%             leader in the minimum approach of fixed leading and
%             free-flying trailing. 
%   'trailer': Same as 'leader" except trailer. Meaning, the leading is
%              actually always trailing when finding the minimum approach. 
%
%   Outputs: 
%   (1) posA, [nx4] matrix interpreted as [time, X, Y, Z]. Position
%       data for leading spacecraft in SRF
%   (2) posB, [nx6] matrix interpreted as [timeX, timeY, timeZ, X, Y, Z]
%       corresponding to the timeshifts and associated position data in
%       leading SRF that brings the trailing spacecraft closest to the
%       leading spacecraft, constrained on dist_constrain and variable
%       input 'leader' or 'trailer', or no forcing. 
%
%   (3) indexA, [nx1], indicies to extract data associated to the closest
%       approach of a fixed leading spacecraft. This is simply the leading
%       spacecraft data trunacted by [see line 67]
%   (4) indexB, [nx3], indicies to extracted data associated to the cloesst
%       approach of a free-flying traailing spacecraft in the X, Y, Z
%       independently. Interpreted as [Index_X, Index_Y, Index_Z]
